# burger
RCB-HW14 (first full-stack with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM)

* When a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger -- waiting to be devoured.
* When the user clicks `Devour` button, the burger status is changed to `devoured` and moves.
* When the user clicks `Delete` button, the burger will be removed from the card.

The app is following MVC design pattern using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
